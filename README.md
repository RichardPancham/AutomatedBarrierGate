### Our project aims to create an automated barrier gate system that combines IR beam sensors, a luminosity sensor, and a mobile application to make vehicle entry and exit easier. The main goal is to book a parking spot on the application then use the application to automatically raise or lower the barrier gate accordingly. Our ultimate vision is to develop a system that is both reliable and efficient, ensuring enhanced security and convenience in managing access to a specific area.
